## SHORT DESCRIPTION
In the development of this code, the MPLAB IDE and the XC8 compiler were used to establish the behavior of a line-following robot during its performance on the track.

This robot has three sensors that detect the track and its response depends on them, two motors with four wires which gives it the ability to control the direction of rotation of the tires independently and three LEDs on the back to indicate the direction of rotation and when it stops.
